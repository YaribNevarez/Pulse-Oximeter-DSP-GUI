# Pulse-Oximeter-DSP-GUI
# Hardware Software base libraries.

Abstract:

Embedded computer systems have driven many advances in almost every aspect of life, including medical applications. In many cases, these applications require data acquisition, digital signal processing (DSP), graphical user interfaces (GUI), communication protocols and more. This work achieves the implementation of a pulse oximeter through the usage of a base hardware and software libraries. The focus of this work is the development of these base libraries, it can be described as a generic hardware-software application framework adequate for rapid and reliable development.

The Hardware-software application framework covers the implementation of a configurable enhanced SPI hardware, DSP software libraries and its automated design and simulation in MATLAB Simulink with legacy code, device drivers for analogue to digital converters (ADC), digital to analogue converter (DAC), programmable gain amplifier (PGA), colour display, and high level software libraries for graphics, UI widget components, and a serial communication link layer.

The software libraries are completely written in C language using object oriented programming (C++ style), software design patterns, and data structures. Dynamic memory allocation is used and extendable for a memory management unit, the memory handling approach is free of memory leaks and NULL pointer exceptions.
